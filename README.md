# 2D Java Game Framework

A collection of classes used for 2d game programming in Java. Much of the dirty work is taken care which makes this useful for beginner game programmers. 

## Installation

1. install the java JDK7.
2. clone this repo.
3. run https://github.com/Wayrix70/Game/releases/tag/v1.2 if on windows, https://github.com/Wayrix70/Game/releases/tag/v1.2 if on linux, or compile it with netbeans.
4. add the .jar file created to your project.

## Usage

After building the framework, add the .jar file to your project. Once added to your project have your class extend "https://github.com/Wayrix70/Game/releases/tag/v1.2" and implement all the methods from the abstract class. Once everything is set up correctly just run the project and you should see a blank window with a blue background. (Better instructions to come later! :p)
